# Url Shortener

This is a solution to Robex tech tribe Angular cohort Week 3 Challenge. 

## Overview

The main feature of the site is the url shortening service. You input a url and It 
displays a shorter url that points to the same resource as the original url

The site is responsive and also includes
- A button that automatically copies a shortened url when clicked
- Url validation that's inbuilt into the form

### What I learned
I learnt about angular forms, it's various methods, attributes and how it can make managing html form state easier. 
It was also what I used to build the site's form as well as all it's data validation, state management e.t.c
I also learnt how to make http requests with angular's `HttpClient`. The `HttpClient` was used to make the external
requests to the api that was responsible for shortening the links
